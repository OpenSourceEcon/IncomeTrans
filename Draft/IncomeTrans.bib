%   abstract={The recent public debt crisis in most developed economies implies an urgent need for increasing tax revenues or cutting government spending. In this paper we study the importance of household heterogeneity and the progressivity of the labor income tax schedule for the ability of the government to generate tax revenues. We develop an overlapping generations model with uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, endogenous human capital accumulation as well as labor supply decisions along the intensive and extensive margins. We calibrate the model to macro, micro and tax data from the US as well as a number of European countries, and then for each country characterize the labor income tax Laffer curve under the current country-specific choice of the progressivity of the labor income tax code. We find that more progressive labor income taxes significantly reduce tax revenues. For the US, converting to a flat tax code raises the peak of the laffer curve by 7\%. We also find that modeling household heterogeneity is important for the shape of the Laffer curve.},

None of the models predict that as much as 25 percent of the conventional cost could be offset, however.

%   abstract={In this paper we compute the optimal tax and education policy transition in an economy where progressive taxes provide social insurance against idiosyncratic wage risk, but distort the education decision of households. Optimally chosen tertiary education subsidies mitigate these distortions. We highlight the quantitative importance of general equilibrium feedback effects from policies to relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers: subsidizing higher education increases the share of workers with a college degree thereby reducing the college wage premium which has important redistributive benefits. We also argue that a full characterization of the transition path is crucial for policy evaluation. We find that optimal education policies are always characterized by generous tuition subsidies, but the optimal degree of income tax progressivity depends crucially on whether transitional costs of policies are explicitly taken into account and how strongly the college premium responds to policy changes in general equilibrium.},

The effect of the aging population is large by itself and depends significantly on how the government finances the cost of the demographic change.

We discuss the role of assumptions about general macroeconomic modeling issues like market behavioral parameters, and the actions of fiscal and monetary authorities. Estimating the revenue feedback effects of tax policy also requires several applied measurement issues that do not typically arise in macroeconomic modeling. Each of these issues introduces significant sources of uncertainty into the macroeconomic analysis of tax policy. We use simulations of a hypothetical 10 percent cut in individual income tax rates to illustrate issues and challenges.},

%   abstract={We examine the use of dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to analyze the economic effects of tax reforms, using as a paradigm our Diamond?Zodrow (DZ) model. Such models are especially well-suited to analyzing both the short-run transitional and the long-run dynamic macroeconomic effects of tax reforms, including the time paths of reform-induced changes in labor supply, saving, and investment, as well as the redistributional effects of reforms across and within generations. We begin with a brief overview of the use of OLG-CGE models in the analysis of tax reform, focusing on the seminal contribution of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987). We then consider a variety of extensions of this work, including the multiple-good, multiple-individual model constructed by Fullerton and Rogers (1993), as well as the addition of open economy factors, human capital accumulation and uncertainty. Many of the applications of these models have focused on changes in capital income taxation or, more generally, the replacement of an income tax system that fully taxes capital income with a consumption-based tax system that exempts normal returns to capital, and we focus on such reforms. We describe in considerable detail the DZ model, which is characterized by 55 cohorts, 12 income groups within each cohort, four production sectors and explicit calculation of reform-induced changes in asset values. We conclude by describing numerous applications of the DZ model, ranging from incremental reforms of the income tax system including deficit-financed tax cuts to ?fundamental tax reforms? that involve replacing the income tax with a consumption-based tax system, to the implementation of a value-added tax imposed in addition to the income tax as a means of reducing current deficits and the national debt in the US.},

% 	Abstract = {This paper studies the quantitative implications of wealth taxation
% 	(as opposed to capital income taxation) in an incomplete markets
% 	model with return rate heterogeneity across individuals. The key
% 	source of heterogeneity comes from the fact that some individuals
% 	have better entrepreneurial skills than others, allowing them to
% 	obtain a higher return on their wealth. In this environment, consider
% 	a flat-rate wealth tax. This will shift the after-tax return distribution
% 	downward, which has two effects. First, entrepreneurs at the left
% 	tail of the productivity distribution now have an even more negative
% 	return, causing their wealth to shrink (faster) over time, in turn
% 	increasing the share of aggregate wealth owned and operated by the
% 	more skilled entrepreneurs. This reallocation increases aggregate
% 	productivity. Second, and at the same time, because such a wealth
% 	tax is regressive, it increases wealth (and welfare) inequality in
% 	the population. To provide a quantitative assessment of these different
% 	effects and the optimal level of wealth taxation, we build and simulate
% 	an overlapping generations model with individual-specific returns
% 	on capital and idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Entrepreneurial
% 	ability (or rate of return) is allowed to vary both within a generation
% 	and across generations (from father to son). In this environment,
% 	the children of very successful entrepreneurs will inherit large
% 	amounts of wealth but may not be able to work that capital as efficiently.
% 	By taxing all wealth at the same rate, the society can weed out these
% 	low-productivity children from those with better uses of capital.
% 	Clearly, if capital markets were efficient, wealth would be put at
% 	its most productive use without taxes, simply by high productivity
% 	individuals renting capital from those with low returns. In this
% 	sense, incomplete markets is essential to the analysis in this paper.
% 	The key exercise we conduct is to consider an economy calibrated

% 	Abstract = { This article attempts to document and account for the long-run evolution of inheritance. We find that in a country like France the annual flow of inheritance was about 20--25\% of national income between 1820 and 1910, down to less than 5\% in 1950, and back up to about 15\% by 2010. A simple theoretical model of wealth accumulation, growth, and inheritance can fully account for the observed U-shaped pattern and levels. Using this model, we find that under plausible assumptions the annual bequest flow might reach about 20--25\% of national income by 2050. This corresponds to a capitalized bequest share in total wealth accumulation well above 100\%. Our findings illustrate the fact that when the growth rate g is small, and when the rate of return to private wealth r is permanently and substantially larger than the growth rate (say, r \&equals; 4--5\% versus g \&equals; 1--2\%), which was the case in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century and is likely to happen again in the twenty-first century, then past wealth and inheritance are bound to play a key role for aggregate wealth accumulation and the structure of lifetime inequality. Contrary to a widespread view, modern economic growth did not kill inheritance. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.},

% 	Abstract = { This paper presents new homogeneous series on top shares of income and wages from 1913 to 1998 in the United States using individual tax returns data. Top income and wages shares display a U-shaped pattern over the century. Our series suggest that the large shocks that capital owners experienced during the Great Depression and World War II have had a permanent effect on top capital incomes. We argue that steep progressive income and estate taxation may have prevented large fortunes from fully recovering from these shocks. Top wage shares were flat before World War II, dropped precipitously during the war, and did not start to recover before the late 1960s but are now higher than before World War II. As a result, the working rich have replaced the rentiers at the top of the income distribution. ÔøΩ 2001 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
